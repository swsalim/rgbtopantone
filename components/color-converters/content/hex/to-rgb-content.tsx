      <h1>Hex to RGB Conversion</h1>
      <p>
        Accurate color representation is vital in design, whether you're working on digital
        platforms or developing physical assets. The HEX color model, a six-character code, is
        widely used in web design for defining colors in a compact and efficient way. Meanwhile, RGB
        represents colors through combinations of red, green, and blue light, making it ideal for
        digital screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Converting HEX to RGB is a common task for designers and developers to ensure color
        consistency across various applications. Our HEX to RGB converter simplifies this process,
        providing instant and accurate results.
      </p>
      <h2>Why should you convert Hex to RGB Colors in Design?</h2>
      <p>
        RGB colors are the foundation of digital displays, enabling vibrant and precise color
        representation. While HEX codes are compact and convenient for web development, they need to
        be converted to RGB values when working with certain design tools or software that require
        RGB input.
      </p>
      <p>
        Converting HEX to RGB ensures your colors are correctly interpreted by these tools,
        maintaining the intended visual impact. Whether you’re designing a website, mobile app, or
        digital content, accurate color conversion is essential.
      </p>

      <h2>What are the key differences between Hex and RGB?</h2>
      <p>
        HEX and RGB are both used for digital colors but serve slightly different purposes. HEX is a
        hexadecimal representation of RGB values, offering a shorthand format for specifying colors
        in web design and CSS. It’s concise and ideal for coding environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        RGB, on the other hand, represents colors through their red, green, and blue light
        intensities, typically ranging from 0 to 255. This format is widely used in graphic design
        software and tools that require a direct representation of light-based colors.
      </p>
